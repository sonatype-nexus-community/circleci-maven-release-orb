  The configuration below will use the maven-release-plugin to perform a "dry run" of a maven release.
  Notice when redefining `mvn-release-perform-command`, you must still specify which maven settings file to use.
  The example below still specifies the default expected by the Orb (`.circleci/.maven.xml`).
  No changes will be committed to source control.
usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    circleci-maven-release-orb: sonatype-nexus-community/circleci-maven-release-orb@x.y.z

  workflows:
    main:
      jobs:
        - circleci-maven-release-orb/run-maven-release:
            ssh-fingerprints: "my:ss:hf:in:ge:rp:ri:nt..."
            mvn-release-perform-command: mvn --batch-mode release:perform -DdryRun=true -s .circleci/.maven.xml
