## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Don't worry, using this community item does not "void your warranty". In a worst case scenario, you may be asked 
by the Sonatype Support team to remove the community item in order to determine the root cause of any issues.

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to Orb support
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this plugin and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!
